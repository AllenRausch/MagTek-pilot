# Unified Information System Platform Evaluation - Criteria Definition

## Objective

As detailed in the [Unified Information System Construction Plan](unified-information-system-construction-plan.md), one of the key elements of the new UIS is identifying tools that will serve as the heart of our system. This document outlines the prioritized criteria for selecting MagTek's new documentation platform. The goal is to choose tools that solve our immediate pain points while building a scalable foundation for the future.

The criteria are split into:

* **Primary**: Essential for adoption and core value
* **Secondary**: Important for long-term efficiency and scale
* **Tertiary**: Important, but not dealbreakers for a particular tool

Stakeholders are encouraged to review these criteria against the characteristics they need for their own workflows and suggest additional considerations. The final recommendation will score each pilot tool against this framework.

## Primary Considerations: Essential for Success

These criteria are non-negotiable for achieving the core goal of a unified, collaborative knowledge base.

| _**Criteria**_                           | _**Why it’s important**_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | _**Relation to MagTek**_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ease of use & contributor experience     | The tool must be usable by both technical (engineers) and non-technical (Technical Writers, PMs, Support, Marketing) contributors. Support needs quick answers during customer calls; marketing needs to update specifications without technical barriers. If it's not easy, adoption will fail. | Directly addresses the "tribal knowledge" problem. We cannot solve information fragmentation if only engineers can contribute.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Built-in Editorial & Collaboration Tools | Must support inline comments, suggestions, and a clear review/approval workflow without relying on external tools or complex Git commands.                                                                                                                                                       | Replaces the inefficient email/chat review cycles and the bottleneck of a single document owner. Critical for cross-team collaboration. Using built-in tools reduces dependencies on interrelated third-party tools and greatly lowers the technical skill needed to maintain and expand the repository. |
| Integration with GitHub Workflow         | The platform must integrate with our GitHub backend to ensure documentation stays in sync with code and fits the engineering team's existing process.                                                                                                                                            | A strategic mandate from leadership. Ensures developer buy-in and makes "docs-as-code" a reality without forcing everyone to use Git directly.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Permissioning & Access Control           | The ability to securely manage access to internal (proprietary) and external (customer) content within a single system.                                                                                                                                                                          | A core requirement for a unified system with both internal and external users with different security access and visibility requirements. Essential for protecting IP while serving customer needs.                                                                                                      |
| Content Findability & Search             | A fast, accurate, and intuitive search function is the primary way users will consume documentation. Poor search renders content useless.                                                                                                                                                        | Directly tackles the pain point of not being able to find information, a problem cited by Support, Engineering, and Test teams.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Version Control & Document History       | The ability to track all changes, see who made what edits and when, and roll back to previous versions if needed. Essential for accountability, audit trails, and recovering from errors.                                                                                                        | Provides transparency across teams and creates a safety net for collaborative editing. Critical for maintaining compliance records and understanding how documentation evolved alongside product development.                                                                                            |
| Multi-Format Export Capabilities         | Documentation must be exportable to PDF, Word, or other formats for offline use, customer deliverables, regulatory submissions, and contexts where web access isn't available.                                                                                                                   | Customers may need offline documentation. Sales and compliance teams may need to provide documentation in specific formats to meet contract or regulatory requirements.                                                                                                                                  |

## Secondary Considerations: Important for Long-Term Health

These criteria are vital for maintaining the system over time and ensuring it grows with the company.

| _**Criteria**_                 | _**Why it’s important**_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | _**Relation to MagTek**_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scalability & Performance      | The platform must be able to handle our entire volume of current and legacy content, the number of contributors, and scale as we add more products and documents without performance degradation.                                                                                                                                                    | While MagTek isn't a "hyper-growth" startup, the company is expanding into new market niches and continuing to add and refine features in current product offerings. As a result, our documentation is currently complex and will continue to grow. The system must not become the next "unusable Word doc" or abandoned proprietary CMS. |
| AI & Future Readiness          | Likelihood of continued vendor support, addition of new features aligned with market trends, and native (and expanding) AI capabilities for improved search, content generation, and knowledge discovery.                                                                                                                                            | Positions Magtek to leverage AI for customer self-service and internal efficiency without a future platform migration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)  | Includes not just licensing costs, but also the internal time required for setup, maintenance, training, and content migration. Hidden costs in our current system include hours spent manually updating the same information across multiple documents and time wasted by employees searching for information that doesn't exist or can't be found. | Justifies the investment by considering the hidden costs of the status quo (time wasted searching for information, inefficient review cycles).                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Vendor Stability & Roadmap     | The vendor should be financially stable and have a public product roadmap that aligns with our long-term needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Ensures we are building on a stable platform that will be supported and improved for years to come, protecting our investment/ Avoids our current “abandoned proprietary CMS” issue with our website.                                                                                                                                     |
| Migration path & content reuse | Tools and features that assist in migrating legacy content and allow for content reuse to avoid duplication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Critical for the Practical task of escaping our legacy systems. Content reuse (chunking, snippets) ensures consistency and simplifies updates across multiple documents.                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Guiding Principle: The "Lowest Tech User" Test

The final recommendation will be weighted most heavily against the **Primary Considerations**. A tool that is perfect for engineers but unusable for marketing and support fails the test. We are not just choosing a publishing tool; we are choosing a **collaboration platform** that must serve the entire MagTek ecosystem.
